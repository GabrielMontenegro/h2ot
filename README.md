# h2ot

Draft for HTTP/2 for IoT. Please fork your own branch and issue pull requests as appropriate into this master branch.

Before issuing your pull requests, please run your version of the file through http://xml2rfc.ietf.org/ to ensure it builds properly.

Only then, issue the pull request. Otherwise, xml2rfc is so brittle this would get out of hand very quickly. There are some automation
capabilities via make ghpages etc, but I have not been able to get them to work in my pseudo linux environment via windows bash. Gabriel
